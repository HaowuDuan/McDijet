## Input tables for xG and xh: file misc.dat

* The small x evolution of the WW TMD xG(α_s Y, q⟂) and xh(α_s Y, q⟂) was precomputed, tabulated and saved in the file misc.dat.

* We used the conventional fixed coupling JIMWLK evolution equations.

* For those who are interested in using your own implementation of small x evolution we provide the
decription of the file format

		1. First Pt_size lines in misc.dat are the values of the momentum q⟂/Q_s0 (from the minimal value to the maximal one), where Q_s0 is the saturation momentum at x=x_0;
		2. Next Y_size lines in misc.dat are the values of the (alphaY)/alpha_s_ref, where (alphaY) is the resummation variable α_sY in JIMWLK. The current value of alpha_s_ref is 0.15; it is hardwired in the tables; it is only the reference value of α_s and is NOT the value of α_s used in the actual physical computations. If you want to change α_s change the variable alpha_s instead.
		3. Next Pt_size x Y_size lines are the values of xG (see the normalization below); the ordering is explained in the following pseudocode
		```
		for Y from 0 to Ymax:
			for qT from qTmin to qTmax:
			print xG(Y, qT)      
		```
		4. Next Pt_size x Y_size lines are the values of xh (see the normalization below); the ordering is explained above
		5. Note that the steps 3 and 4 do not contain the properly normalized xh and xG but instead
		```
			α_s xG /(2 L^2)  = 1/L^2 \int d^2x/(2π)^2  d^2y/(2π)^2 exp(-iq⋅(x-y)) A_{i,a}(x)  A_{i,a}(y)
			with   A_i(x) = 1/i U†(x) ∂_i U(x)
		```
		where L is the length of the lattice in the lattice units. In the code S_perp_JIMWLK =  2704.0 = L^2. If your tables use different L, S_perp_JIMWLK should be properly adjusted. The normalization for xh is similar as for xG.

* Relevant variables to look for:
	```
	const size_t Y_size=21, Pt_size=178;
	const double qt_min = 1.0;
	const double qt_max = 30.0;
	const double Y_inp_max=6.666670;
	constexpr double X0 = 1e-2;
	const double alpha_s_ref = .15;
	S_perp_JIMWLK =  2704.0;
	```
